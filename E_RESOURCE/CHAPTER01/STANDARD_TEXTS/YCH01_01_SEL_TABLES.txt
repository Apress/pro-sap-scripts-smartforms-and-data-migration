 LINEP3<C1>Structure of Selection Tables</>
 LINEP1
 LINEP1
 LINEP2The structure of a selection table consists of four fields:
 LINE=  SIGN, OPTION LOW, and HIGH. Each row of a selection table
 LINE=  constitutes a sub-condition for the complete selection
 LINE=  criterion. Following is a description of the selection table
 LINE=  fields:
 LINEP1<C2>SIGN</>
 LINEP2The field SIGN is of data type C and length 1. The field SIGN
 LINE=  can assume either of the two values:.
 LINEP2I for inclusion
 LINEP2E for exclusion
 LINEP1<C2>OPTION</>
 LINEP2The field OPTION is of data type C and length 2. The field
 LINE=   OPTION contains the selection operator and can assume the
 LINE=   following values:
 LINEP2If the field HIGH contains INITIAL value, the field OPTION can
 LINE=  assume any of these values: EQ, NE, GT, GE, LT, LE, CP, and NP
 LINE=  (Single values or single pattern values)
 LINEP2 If the field HIGH is not INITIAL, the field OPTION can assume any of
 LINE=  these values: BT and NB. (Range values)
 LINEP1<C2>LOW</>
 LINEP2The data type and length of the field LOW is derived from the data
 LINE=  object or the type to which the selection table variable is referring.
 LINEP1<C2>HIGH</>
 LINEP2The data type and length of the field HIGH is also derived from the
 LINE=  data object or the type to which the selection table variable is
 LINE=   referring.
